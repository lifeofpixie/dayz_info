# DayZ Info

This repository contains publicly available reference information for DayZ, including
modded items, values, and related data from various third-party mods.

The JSON files in this repository are primarily used for my own bots and automation
projects, but anyone is free to use them.

## Data Source & Conversion
All data is manually extracted from publicly available mod configuration (CPP) files
and converted into JSON format. Because this process is manual, minor errors or
outdated values may occasionally occur.

The goal is to provide a central place for useful DayZ reference data for players,
server owners, developers, and the community.

## Disclaimer
All mod-related data in this repository is sourced from publicly available information.
This project does not create, modify, or distribute any DayZ mods.

All mod content, names, and data belong to their respective creators.
This repository is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or legally responsible for any third-party mods.

## Usage
- Bot and automation projects
